# autogit

Don't you hate having to navigate to every single git repository in your `projects` folder and update them all by hand?

`autogit` aims to solve this!
Simply run autogit in the root `projects` folder (or wherever you have your git repos), and autogit will take a look at each repo and update them if possible.
